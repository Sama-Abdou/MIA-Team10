#### **A DC brushed suction system is suitable for enhancing the cleaning efficiency and waste collection capabilities of the APC machine.**
> **Having a couple of advantages making them well-suited for this application, to name a few:**

1. Offer precise speed and torque control,
which is essential for adjusting the suction power according to the nature of debris encountered.

2. Provide high levels of power and torque,
allowing the suction system to generate strong force for effective vacuuming and waste collection.

3. Have high energy efficiency,
which is important for maximizing the APC's operational time and minimizing power consumption.

4. Known for their reliability and durability,
making them withstand the rigors of cleaning tasks and provide consistent performance over time.

5. Have relatively compact and lightweight, 
which is advantageous for the APC as It allows easier integration of the suction system into the overall design.

> **While it offers several advantages,
it's important to consider potential drawbacks and limitations as well, to name a few:**

1. They rely on physical brushes to transfer electrical current to the rotor.
Over time, these brushes can wear out and require replacement or maintenance and due to accumulation of debris it faces faster brush wear.

2. Compared to brushless DC motors, they have a shorter lifespan due to the wear and tear associated with the brushes.
This may result in more frequent motor replacements or repairs, increasing maintenance costs and downtime.

3. Brushes can cause "ElectroMagnetic Interference" due to the electrical arcing that occurs during brush-to-commutator contact.
This affects nearby electronics & sensitive equipment, which could be a concern in certain environments or applications.

4. Brushed motors tend to be less efficient compared to brushless counterparts.
Which results in increased power consumption and heat generation, which may require additional cooling mechanisms to prevent overheating.

> **Finally the specific requirements of the APC machine and the benefits offered by the high-performance DC brushed suction system should be evaluated to determine if the advantages outweigh the potential drawbacks in the given context.**
#### **And in the context of WALL-E & EVE saving the planet it's deemed to be beneficial thus suitable.**
